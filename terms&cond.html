                                            Freshcatch.info aims to assist buyers who have been defrauded by sellers on the Website. If a buyer makes a payment for
                                            an item and either does not receive it or receives a significantly different item than described, the buyer may file a

                                            in detail at the Buyer Protection and Refund Policies section on the Website. If Freshcatch.info suspects that any of
